Actually there are somethings in English which haven\\'t yet been named explicitly rather are known genuinely by the names which are precisely different, derived from other contexts or scenarios and also the one which sounds like this perfectly relates to them however they are not the ones that we often understand when hear or see and so is the case with these words pride, sault and troop. They all are different as well as mean different but it\\'s the context, characteristics and classes that make the words perfect to be used in other cases as well. So other words could also be sault, troop etc. Or simply we can use a phrase to mean them ie \"a company of lions\".

If you want it to be priority it will still take 2-3 days. Otherwise across the country it could take 3-5 days. Not including weekends. And for packages 7-10 days. International could take up to almost two weeks if you are lucky. I always send things with a tracking number.source: How long does regular mail take with in the same state? Was this answer helpful?

      "Body: Answers.com ® Wiki Answers ® Categories Business & Finance Business and Industry Industries and Professions How long does it take to get a bachelor's in computer engineering? Flag How long does it take to get a bachelor's in computer engineering? Edit Answer by Joe Ragusa Confidence votes 98.5KA bachelor's degree in most areas can require between 124 to 128 college credits particular to a specific program of study. This would be based on a college or university that operates on a regular two semester academic year which is the most common. For institutions that operate on a tri-semester or quarter-semester it would be quite different. That being said, the Bachelor's degree - in most cases - is designed as a four year program of study, provided the student is full-time and follows their chosen program of study as prescribed by the college or university, and also provided the individual does not require prerequisite or developmental coursework as a result of basic skills testing. The minimum credit load for a full-time student is no less than 12 credits per semester. However, to complete the degree within the four years, a credit load of approximately 15 to 18 credits is recommended. For individuals who work or who have other responsibilities that would prohibit them from attending full-time, completion of the degree may take twice as long. Still, some of this time can be cut down by attending summer sessions and/or interim sessions. In addition, the bachelors and associate degrees are referred to as undergraduate degrees while the Masters and Doctorate degrees referred to as graduate degrees.2 people found this useful Was this answer useful?

    "Main differences between fit_transform and transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fit_transform:\n",
    "    - When applied to training data, fit_transform first 'fits' or 'trains' the transformer on the data. This means it learns any necessary parameters from the data, such as the mean and standard deviation for scaling or the document-term matrix in text vectorization.\n",
    "    - After fitting, it immediately 'transforms' the training data according to these learned parameters. This means it applies the learned transformation rules to the data, such as scaling the data or converting text data into a numeric format.\n",
    "    - The result of fit_transform is the transformed version of the input data, ready for training a machine learning model.\n",
    "    - fit_transform is typically used on the training dataset to prepare the transformer for later use on other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - transform is used after the transformer has been fitted. If you have new data that you want to process in the same way as the training data, you'd use transform.\n",
    "    - It applies the transformation rules learned during the fit phase to new data. The new data gets transformed without re-learning the transformation parameters.\n",
    "    - This method ensures that the transformation on new data is consistent with the transformation performed on the training data.\n",
    "    - transform is used on new or testing datasets to apply the same transformation as learned from the training dataset."

    "    We appreciate a decrease in P@10 when moving from title-only (0.5) to whole-text (0.1) vectorization when it comes to predicting **a single query (251898)** which can happen for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. $\\underline{\\text{Noisy Data:}}$ Titles are generally concise and highly relevant to the content of the document, but the body might include a lot of additional information, some of which could be considered noise in the context of the specific query. This noise might dilute the relevance signals that were clear in the title alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. $\\underline{\\text{Keyword Dilution:}}$ When using the entire text, the frequency of key terms from the title might be diluted among many other terms, leading to less distinctive vectors for relevance ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. $\\underline{\\text{Overfitting to Titles:}}$ The model or the baseline might be overfitting to the style or keywords found in titles. When you add the body text, the model's ability to distinguish relevant from non-relevant documents might decrease because it's now relying on features that are not as strongly indicative of relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. $\\underline{\\text{Vector Space Dimensionality:}}$ Including the full text increases the dimensionality of the vector space significantly (since you likely have more unique words in the full texts than in the titles), which can sometimes lead to poorer performance if not managed correctly, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the \"curse of dimensionality.\""

    "\n",
    "    However and unexpectedly, the average P@10 score improves when using the whole text (0.4816) instead of just the titles (0.319) for a training set of 500 queries, this suggests that including the body of the documents provides a more comprehensive set of features that help in identifying relevant documents. Here are some possible reasons for this improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Richer Context**: Whole text contains more context and information than titles alone, which can lead to better matching with queries, especially for complex queries that require more context to interpret correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Detailed Content**: The body of a document often contains detailed discussions of topics that might only be briefly mentioned in the title. This can help in capturing the relevance for queries that are more specific and detailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Keyword Occurrence**: Important keywords may occur in the body text that do not appear in the titles. These occurrences can contribute to a more accurate representation of the document's content and hence improve the matching with queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Diverse Vocabulary**: The body text introduces a wider and more diverse vocabulary. This can help differentiate documents more precisely and match a broader range of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Long-tail Queries**: For more descriptive or long-tail queries, the chance that the relevant terms appear in the body rather than just the title is higher. Thus, the whole text provides a better chance of matching these queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **Overfitting to Training Set**: It's also possible that the model has become better at matching the patterns in the training set specifically when using the whole text, which might not generalize as well to unseen queries or a different test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, while the P@10 score might decrease for individual queries when using the whole text, the average P@10 score across a large set of queries can improve if the additional context and information contained in the full text leads to better overall matching between queries and documents."

    "   These outcomes can seem counterintuitive, but they highlight how the choice of text representation can significantly impact the performance of information retrieval systems. Let's consider the possible reasons behind these results:\n",

    "1. **CountVectorizer (binary=False) with Whole Text (P@10=0.046 for the training set, 0.0 for a single query):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - When binary=False, the CountVectorizer accounts for term frequency. This can be detrimental if the frequency isn't normalized because common words may dominate the feature representation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Including the whole text likely introduces a lot of common words and phrases, which might not be relevant to the query's intent, leading to a diluted signal for relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CountVectorizer (binary=False) with Titles (P@10=0.046 for the training set, 0.0 for a single query):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The same frequency issue applies, but because titles are shorter and more focused, we might expect better performance. However, if the gold standard heavily favors certain keywords or phrases that are lost in the non-binary representation, performance can suffer as seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CountVectorizer (binary=True) with Whole Text (P@10=0.4816 for the training set, 0.1 for a single query):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Surprisingly, using a binary representation with the whole text has performed quite well for the training set. This might indicate that the mere presence of certain words, regardless of their frequency, is a strong indicator of relevance across your queries.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For the single query, the score is much lower (0.1), suggesting this query might be an outlier or not well represented in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CountVectorizer (binary=True) with Titles (P@10=0.319 for the training set, 0.5 for a single query):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - This is the best-performing scenario for the single query, indicating that specific keywords in the titles are highly relevant for this query.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For the training set, while still decent, it’s not as high as with the whole text, possibly due to the reduced context that titles provide, which might not capture the full scope of relevance.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Importance of Title vs. Whole Text:** Titles can often be quite descriptive of the main content, but they might lack some context that the body of the text provides. However, including the full text may introduce noise, which can be particularly problematic if not managed by proper normalization or term weighting like TF-IDF, which we will consider later on the Notebook.\n",

    "Based on the P@10 results for different text processing and vectorization approaches, we can draw several conclusions and identify potential areas for improvement. The results indicate varying levels of effectiveness in capturing the relevance of documents to queries, which is crucial for information retrieval tasks. Here's a summary and analysis, following the order of performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TF-IDF with whole text (not cleaned) + max_df = 0.7, min_df = 2 and max_features = 55000 obtained 0.899**: This approach yielded the best performance, suggesting that the inclusion of both frequent and infrequent terms (controlled by max_df and min_df) in a relatively large feature set (max_features=55000) captures a rich set of relevance signals, even without explicit text cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF with heuristic_combined (cleaned(title)x2 + cleaned(body)) obtained 0.888 with max_features = 50000**: Close to the top performer, this strategy emphasizes title terms by doubling their presence, which intuitively boosts the weight of potentially more relevant terms found in titles. Cleaning the text also seems to contribute positively, removing noise that might dilute important signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TF-IDF with cleaned_text obtained 0.885 with max_features = 50000**: Slightly underperforming compared to the heuristic combination, directly cleaning the text without specific emphasis on titles still yields high performance, reinforcing the value of preprocessing steps in enhancing the quality of the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BM25 with cleaned_text obtained 0.843**: As a well-regarded algorithm for information retrieval, BM25's lower performance compared to the top TF-IDF configurations might be due to the particular characteristics of the dataset or the choice of k1 and b parameters. Nonetheless, its strong performance underscores the effectiveness of relevance-based scoring mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binary vectorization on whole_text obtained 0.482**: Representing a significant drop in effectiveness, binary vectorization on the whole text suggests that mere presence/absence signals without frequency or TF-IDF weighting are less informative for relevance determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Binary vectorization on titles obtained 0.319**: Binary vectorization's lower performance on titles alone highlights the challenge of relying solely on the presence or absence of terms in titles, which may not capture enough contextual or semantic information for accurate relevance scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Non-binary vectorization on whole_text and titles both obtained 0.046**: Surprisingly, treating term frequencies in a non-binary manner for both whole texts and titles underperformed significantly. This suggests that without proper normalization or weighting, raw frequencies may introduce noise or overemphasize less relevant terms, obscuring meaningful relevance signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Selection and Dimensionality**: I would experiment with different values for `max_features`, `max_df`, and `min_df` to fine-tune the balance between including informative terms and excluding noise. Advanced dimensionality reduction techniques could also be explored.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Parameter Tuning for BM25**: It could be adjusted BM25's `k1` and `b` parameters could potentially improve its performance to better reflect the dataset's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combining Signals**: Leveraging a combination of different vectorization and scoring methods could harness the strengths of each approach. Ensemble methods or machine learning models that can learn from multiple feature sets might offer enhanced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Understanding**: Exploring embeddings that capture deeper semantic meanings, such as those from language models (e.g., BERT), could provide more nuanced relevance signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are intriguing and highlight the importance of methodical experimentation with text processing and vectorization techniques in information retrieval tasks. The success of TF-IDF approaches, especially with careful feature selection and text preprocessing, is noteworthy, though the strong showing of BM25 also underscores the value of relevance-focused scoring methods."
