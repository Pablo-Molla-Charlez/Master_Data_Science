    "To implement a Count-Min Sketch in Python, which is a probabilistic data structure used for approximate frequency estimation, we will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initializing the Sketch: We set up a 2D array (matrix) with dimensions $d \\times w$. These dimensions are determined by the error parameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $\\epsilon$: This parameter controls the width (w) of the sketch, which determines the accuracy of the frequency estimates. Smaller values of $\\epsilon$ lead to wider sketches and more accurate estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$w = ceil(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $\\delta$: This parameter controls the depth (d) of the sketch, affecting the confidence of the estimates. Smaller values of $\\delta$ result in more hash functions (rows), reducing the probability of overestimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$d = ceil(ln(\\frac{1}{\\delta}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choosing Hash Functions: As described, we will generate $d$ different hash functions. Each function will be determined by two randomly chosen coefficients $a$ and $b$ and a large prime number $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Updating the Sketch: For each element in the data stream, we update the sketch using the hash functions to map the element to one of the $w$ columns in each of the $d$ rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Querying the Sketch: To estimate the frequency of an element, we apply all $d$ hash functions and take the minimum value among the corresponding $w$ columns in the sketch.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Comparing with Exact Counts: Finally, we compare the frequency estimations from the Count-Min Sketch with the exact counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: In this implementation, we initialize the Count-Min Sketch with specified $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ values, we use the given method to generate multiple hash functions and update the counts based on incoming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we compare the results of the Count-Min Sketch to actual frequencies, noting that there might be some overestimation due to the probabilistic nature of the Count-Min Sketch."

When epsilon is smaller (0.01 in the first example), the CountMinSketch provides very accurate estimates of the counts, with most of the estimated counts matching the exact counts. Based on this we can infer that a smaller epsilon leads to more precise frequency estimates.\n",

Essentially, the difference in epsilon showcases a trade-off between accuracy and space efficiency (since a smaller epsilon requires more space).\n",
