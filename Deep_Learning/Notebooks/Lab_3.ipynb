However, this kind of operation (using the transpose of the weights matrix) isn't typical in a forward pass of a neural network‚Äîit's more akin to what happens during the backpropagation step when gradients are being computed."

Setting the bias to zero is like starting from a neutral position, allowing the weights (which are initialized using the Glorot method) to take the lead in learning from the data. This way, each neuron begins learning without any initial push in a particular direction, making it easier for the network to adjust and learn the patterns in the data effectively.\n",

    "### Final Report on MNIST Classification Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Overview:**\n",
    "The model employed is a single-layer neural network utilizing an affine transformation followed by a softmax output. We have trained the model using the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) as the loss function and have implemented a basic Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "Training was conducted on the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark comprising 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, labeled 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process:**\n",
    "Training proceeded for 20 epochs, each involving a shuffle of the training data to ensure randomness in the mini-batch SGD process. The data was reshaped to fit the model, and a forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and parameter update sequence were executed iteratively for each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results Summary:**\n",
    "- Loss Analysis: The loss showed a general decreasing trend over 20 epochs, starting from 0.9565 to 0.8133. This indicates that the model was learning and improving its predictions over time, adjusting its parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Accuracy Trends: Training accuracy experienced some fluctuations throughout the epochs. It began at 89.102% and saw variations, with a notable dip to 84.832% at epoch 6 and peaking at 91.476% by epoch 9. The training accuracy closed at 88.678% in epoch 20. These fluctuations suggest that the model's performance on the training set varied significantly, which could be due to the learning rate adjustments or the inherent stochastic nature of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Development (Validation) Accuracy Movements: Similar to training accuracy, development accuracy also fluctuated. It started at 89.82%, dropped to 84% at epoch 6, reached its highest at 91.17% by epoch 9, and ended at 87.72% by epoch 20. The peaks and troughs in validation accuracy indicate that the model's generalization to unseen data varied significantly throughout the training process, which could be reflective of overfitting to the training data in certain epochs or possibly the impact of learning rate adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Final Test Accuracy: The model achieved a test accuracy of 91.26% on unseen data. This is a strong result, suggesting that despite the fluctuations in training and development accuracy, the model was able to generalize well to new data. The test accuracy being in close range to the highest development accuracy indicates a balanced model without significant overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- The development set's accuracy fluctuated above and below the training accuracy, suggesting that the model may be on the verge of overfitting, as indicated by the highest dev accuracy not occurring at the last epoch.\n",
    "- The development accuracy, while generally improving, did not exhibit a clear upward trend. This could suggest the model might benefit from more complex architectures or regularization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Future Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**: We could introduce L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights and mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Learning Rate Schedule**: We could implement adaptive learning rates, like learning rate decay or advanced optimizers (e.g., Adam), which can help converge faster and possibly reach better local minima.\n",
    "3. **Model Complexity**: We could introduce more layers (a deeper network) or hidden units (a wider network) to capture more complex features, potentially increasing accuracy.\n",
    "4. **Early Stopping**: We could monitor the development accuracy and stop training when it no longer improves, using the best model on the development set for the final evaluation.\n",
    "5. **Data Augmentation**: We could employ techniques such as rotation, translation, or scaling to artificially expand the training dataset and improve generalization.\n",
    "6. **Batch Processing**: We could, instead of stochastic updates, use mini-batch gradient descent to take advantage of vectorized operations for faster processing.\n",
    "7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically search for the best hyperparameters, including the learning rate and batch size, possibly employing grid search or random search methods.\n",
    "8. **Dropout**: We could introduce dropout layers, mentioned in class, to prevent co-adaptation of neurons and encourage individual feature detection.\n",
    "9. **Cross-validation**: We could use k-fold cross-validation to make better use of the development data and achieve a more robust estimation of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The implemented model demonstrates decent classification performance on the MNIST dataset. However, there is room for improvement, particularly in addressing the potential for overfitting and exploring more advanced model architectures or training schemes to further boost accuracy."
